        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h5 style="text-decoration: none;">Shatter the Silence is a student-led program dedicated to raising awareness 
            about sexual violence and making a stand against it. Our mission is to spread 
            awareness, support survivors, and drive meaningful change within our 
            communities. Sexual violence is a pervasive issue that affects individuals 
            regardless of age, background, or identity, and it’s time we confront it 
            head-on. Through education, advocacy, and open dialogue, we aim to challenge 
            harmful societal norms, break the stigma surrounding sexual violence, and 
            create safe spaces for survivors to share their stories without fear or 
            judgment. <br><br>

            Every story shared, every fact learned, and every voice raised has the power 
            to make a difference. We believe that awareness is the first step toward 
            prevention and that informed communities are empowered communities. By 
            standing together, we can amplify the voices of survivors, demand 
            accountability, and foster a culture of respect and consent. <br><br>
            
            Your voice matters. Every voice counts. We need your support to create lasting 
            change, not just for today but for future generations. Join us in our mission 
            to shatter the silence, challenge injustice, and advocate for a world where 
            everyone feels safe, heard, and valued. Together, we can make a real impact. <br></h5>

        <h1>Our Aim</h1>
        <h5>
            Our campaign against sexual violence aims to create a lasting impact by 
            spreading awareness, educating communities, and fostering meaningful change. 
            Sexual violence is a widespread issue that affects people of all ages, 
            genders, and backgrounds. To combat this, we focus on addressing critical 
            issues such as harassment, peer pressure, good touch/bad touch, consent, 
            stalking, dating violence, cyber security, and the importance of community 
            involvement. By tackling these topics, we aim to equip individuals with the 
            knowledge and tools they need to recognize, prevent, and respond to situations
             related to sexual violence. <br><br>

Education is the foundation of our campaign. We believe that open conversations and proper 
guidance can break down the stigma surrounding sexual violence, encouraging more people to 
speak up and seek help. Through workshops, awareness drives, and interactive sessions, we 
strive to create safe spaces where individuals feel heard, supported, and empowered to take
 action. <br><br>

Collaboration is key to our mission. By working alongside NGOs, educational institutions, 
and community organizations, we can amplify our efforts and reach a wider audience. 
These partnerships help us share resources, implement prevention programs, and advocate 
for policies that prioritize the safety and well-being of individuals. <br><br>

Our vision extends beyond local communities. We believe that change starts at the 
grassroots level, but it doesn’t end there. By building strong foundations locally, 
we aim to expand our efforts nationally and, eventually, make a global difference. 
Our goal is to create a world where conversations about consent, respect, and safety 
are normalized, and where survivors are supported without judgment or fear. <br><br>

Together, through awareness, education, and collective action, we can challenge harmful 
norms, promote prevention, and build a safer, more just world for everyone. <br>
